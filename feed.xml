Today, I want to share some impressions from my previous work experience placement in February with all of you. Please keep in mind that this post is from March, so donâ€™t let the tenses confuse you! ðŸ˜‰</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, my third work experience placement at Nokia Technology Center in Ulm came to an end.</p>

  <p>The last four weeks, my colleagues and fellow students and I have continued our log file analysis project. Based on our findings from the last practical phase, we adapted an open-source command line tool to be able to process the log format we needed. This task required a deep understanding of the log structure, which we had fortunately already acquired last summer when we used various machine learning techniques to find anomalies in said log files. Additionally, we also gained further experience in working with Linux and the command line.</p>

  <p>It was very nice to see again how diverse work at Nokia is. In my last work experience placements, I have already worked with hardware, dived deep into research and now had the chance to work on an open-source project.
Now Iâ€™m looking forward to the next semester at Technische Hochschule Ulm, before Iâ€™ll be back at Nokia in summer, where I will have the chance to do my work experience placement abroad!</p>
