I'm Johannes, a passionate 20-year-old Computer Science student. I believe in harnessing the power of technology to make a positive impact on society.

In my studies, I dive into the fascinating world of Computer Science. I specialize in embedded systems and IT security, equipping myself with the skills to tackle complex challenges in our digital landscape.

I'm fortunate to be part of Nokia, where I work on cutting-edge projects that shape the future of communication and connectivity. Collaborating with brilliant minds, I strive to push the boundaries of technology.

Beyond coding, I find inspiration in the energizing rhythms of rock and metal music. These genres fuel my creativity, bringing a fresh perspective and artistic sensibility to my technological endeavors.

My ultimate goal is to use technology as a force for positive change. I'm dedicated to applying my skills and knowledge to address societal challenges, promote accessibility, and foster ethical and inclusive digital environments.
